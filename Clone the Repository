Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
This allows offline development of code. You can develop features, fix bugs, and test locally, and push
those changes up to the remote repository. It also provides a local backup of the project.
1. Copy the repository URL:
o After creating the repository, you will be redirected to the repository’s page.
o Click the Code button and copy the repository’s URL (it should look like
https://github.com/username/repo-name.git).
2. Clone the repository:
o Open a terminal or Git Bash on your local machine.
o Run the following command to clone the repository (replace your-repo-url with the
URL you copied):
git clone your-repo-url
o You now have a local copy of your GitHub repository.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
o Change the directory to your new repository:
cd devops-beginner
